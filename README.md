# Pomodoro Timer

### What will this be?

The goal of this project is to create a Pomodoro Timer desktop app. This app will have time countdown timer aspect to the general concept of the process, but I would also like it to have a bit more productivity aspects to it. 

The app should have a way to set the times for the work, short break, and long break and track the amount of work cycles. At the end of the timers a notification will go off telling the user to switch to the next part of the cycle. Using it will allow users to see their progress on tasks they have worked on within the times they are using and working on it.

#### Hoping to have:
- A way to add tasks to complete during the work times
- A way to mark off the task after completion, or finishing a work cycle
- Changing the time parameters of the timing and the cycles
- A way to aggregate info on the task completed to complied data to view later
- A calendar to show when using maybe or an easy way to show the progress of the data
- Maybe it emails you with data info
- A sound to go with the end of the timer
- For the timer to come back into to focus when the timer is done to make sure the use focuses on the next portion of the cycle

#### What has been used so far:
- Electron (electron forge template build)
- React
- React-countdown-circle-timer
- CSS Modules
